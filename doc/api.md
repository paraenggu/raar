# RAAR API

Raar provides a simple REST API to access all shows, broadcasts and audio files. Additionally, a secured area allows management of profiles, archive and playback formats. All request and response payload follows the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) format.

The API is documented with [Swagger](http://swagger.io). The current definition is available under the root path of the running server or as a generated artifact in [swagger.json](swagger.json). A nice visualization is available via [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/?baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fradiorabe%2Fraar%2Fmaster%2Fdoc%2Fswagger.json).
