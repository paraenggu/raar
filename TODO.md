# TODOs

## Code

* if mapping is already imported, mark all recordings as imported, too. this may happen if one recording is not ready at the import run and provides its file only later. too bad, then just discard this file.
* create script to import partial broadcasts
* reduce memory usage of import
* create script to adjust playback formats to update old playback formats to the current ones
